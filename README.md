## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Variable Fonts
Unlike traditional fonts, variable fonts store all weight, width, and style variations in one file. They work with "axes," which are design parameters like weight, width, and optical size, and "instances," which are specific combinations of values on those axes. Designers can adjust these variations using CSS, creating diverse styles without multiple files. Variable fonts are ideal for responsive design, web applications, animation, print and digital design, and accessibility.

Examples of Axes: 
- Weight (light to bold)
- Width (spacing)
- Optical Size (optimize readability for different sizes and applications)   
- Slant (italic or oblique variations) 
- Custom Axes (unique variations)

Benefits of Variable Fonts:
- Smaller Files: One file holds many styles.
- Faster Pages: Fewer HTTP requests.
- Design Flexibility: More creative control.
- Readability: Optimized for all screens.
- Simplicity: Easier management of many styles.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> While the Figtree typeface folder was provided for this project, I opted to use Google Fonts to apply the styles. I'd like to do more research on variable fonts before I start throwing lines of code I don't understand into my projects.

### Continued development

- I'm going to:
  - Dive deeper into variable fonts. 
  - Learn more advanced git concepts and commands such as ```merge``` and ```rebase```. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
